        <h2>Administrative Tool 2</h2>
        <p>One of multiple in-house customer administrative tools I wrote to cut down on time consuming data-entry and billing calculation tasks for a customer. Prior to the creation of this application, these administrative tasks were done in a spreadsheet and after a year of manually tracking the data, it became clear calculating recurrent billings would be impossible without the ability to keep track of both historical billings and changes to customer state. Upon completion of this tool, a monthly task which would typically take 4-6 hours was reduced to under a minute.</p>
        <p>It's a Python Flask-based web-application backed by a MySQL (or SQLite) database. Some of its services include: user authentication, internal customer data storage and reporting, and most notably a data import utility that runs import data through an algorithm which calculates the current month's billing.</p>
