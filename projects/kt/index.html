                <h2>Trivia Application</h2>
                <p>A multiplayer trivia web-application targeted at providing customizable quick-deployment trivia games for any industry. Informational cards could be interspersed throughout games to provide supplemental fact-based training in addition to the trivia question. Leaderboards and "improve your score" support were designed to increase player engagement through competition. The administrative panel included full analytics from the full game down to the individual question. Example uses include insurance loss prevention training, automotive customer service, and trade show marketing.</p>
                <p>I was the project manager, designer, and QA lead of this project. I am unable to share the source code as it is not open source.</p>
